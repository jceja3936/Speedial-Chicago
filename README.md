Speedial-Phoenix is the name of a game that does not yet exist, ideas float around however the purpose of this project is largely to learn how to use Godot. Before the end of this summer, May 2025, I want to have completed building 3 levels that can be navigated between within the game, graphics and animations and sound does not matter, this is purely to learn and see if a game in the style of games like "Hotline Miami" are fun and able to be pursued. Completely open source, feel free to fork and work on what I have offered, and enjoy.
